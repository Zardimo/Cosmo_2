# DESCRIPTION
Simple game on python about cosmos, with async python.

# CONTROLS
`UP` - move up   
`DOWN` - move down   
`LEFT` - move left   
`RIGHT` - move right   
`SPACE` - shoot   

# GAME SCENARIO
Based on the idea from the video Trash and satellites around the Earth. 
[Space Debris 1957-2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8U8rmeCnXw)

The pace of the game and all events are tied to years.
One year is 1.5 seconds of playing time. We start from 1957, the year of launch of the first artificial Earth satellite.

Until 1961, space was clean and empty, then garbage appeared.
Over time, it becomes more and more and by 2020 the ship is armed with a plasma gun, so that there is nothing to clear the road.
